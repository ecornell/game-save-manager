### Shared Functionality
- Uses the same `SaveBackupManager` class as CLI
- Reads/writes same `games_config.json` file
- Compatible backup formats
- Same safety features and error handling

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- tkinter (usually included with Python)
- All dependencies from the original CLI tool

## File Structure

```
save-backups/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backup.py              # Original CLI tool
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backup_gui.py           # GUI application (this file)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run_gui.bat            # Windows batch file to launch GUI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ games_config.json      # Shared configuration file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backups/               # Backup storage directory
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [game_name]/       # Per-game backup folders
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backup_*/      # Individual backup directories
```

## Configuration File

The GUI uses the same `games_config.json` format as the CLI:

```json
{
  "games": {
    "game_id": {
      "name": "Game Name",
      "save_path": "C:\\Path\\To\\Saves",
      "backup_path": "C:\\Path\\To\\Backups",
      "description": "Optional description"
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "default_max_backups": 10,
    "auto_expand_paths": true,
    "default_backup_path": "./backups"
  }
}
```

## Tips

1. **First Time Setup**: Use the Configuration tab to add your games
2. **Path Variables**: You can use environment variables like `%USERPROFILE%` in paths
3. **Backup Descriptions**: Use meaningful descriptions to remember why you created a backup
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Use the cleanup feature to manage disk space
5. **Safety**: The GUI always asks for confirmation before destructive operations

## Troubleshooting

### GUI Won't Start
- Ensure Python is installed and in PATH
- Check that `backup.py` is in the same directory
- Verify tkinter is available: `python -c "import tkinter"`

### Game Not Listed
- Check the Configuration tab to add games
- Verify paths exist and are accessible
- Check `games_config.json` syntax

### Backup Operations Fail
- Verify save directory exists and is accessible
- Check disk space in backup directory
- Ensure you have write permissions

### Performance Issues
- Large save directories may take time to backup
- Progress bars show operation status
- Operations run in background threads to keep GUI responsive

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the original CLI tool documentation
2. Verify configuration file syntax
3. Test with the CLI version to isolate GUI-specific issues
