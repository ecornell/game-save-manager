# GUI Restore Button Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified
The "Restore Selected" button in the GUI was not working properly due to two main issues:

### 1. Missing Selection Event Handler
**Problem**: The backup tree view wasn't updating button states when items were selected/deselected.
**Root Cause**: No event handler was bound to the `<<TreeviewSelect>>` event.

### 2. Potential Index Calculation Issue  
**Problem**: There was a risk of incorrect backup index calculation when calling the CLI restore method.
**Root Cause**: The CLI expects 1-based indices, but the calculation could potentially be incorrect.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Added Selection Event Handler
**Location**: Line 152 in `backup_gui.py`
```python
# Bind selection event to update button states
self.backup_tree.bind("<<TreeviewSelect>>", self.on_backup_selected)
```

**Added Method**: 
```python
def on_backup_selected(self, event=None):
    """Handle backup selection in the tree"""
    self.update_button_states()
```

**Effect**: Now when users select items in the backup list, the restore and delete buttons are properly enabled/disabled.

### Fix 2: Improved Error Handling in Restore Method
**Location**: Lines 477-500 in `backup_gui.py`
**Changes**:
- Added try/catch around `backups.index(backup_path)` call
- More specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Better error handling for missing backup paths

**Before**:
```python
backup_index = backups.index(backup_path) + 1
success = self.manager.restore_backup(backup_index)
```

**After**:
```python
try:
    backup_index = backups.index(backup_path) + 1  # Convert to 1-based index
    success = self.manager.restore_backup(backup_index)
except ValueError:
    self.hide_progress()
    self.root.after(0, lambda: messagebox.showerror("Error", "Could not find backup in list"))
```

### Fix 3: Applied Same Improvements to Delete Method
**Location**: Lines 547-570 in `backup_gui.py`
**Changes**: Applied the same error handling improvements to the delete backup functionality.

## Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:
- ✅ GUI import test passed
- ✅ Backup manager integration test passed  
- ✅ Treeview selection test passed

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
- Users could select backups but buttons remained disabled
- No visual feedback when selecting items
- Potential crashes on restore attempts

### After Fix  
- Buttons properly enable/disable based on selection
- Clear error messages for any issues
- Reliable restore and delete operations
- Better user feedback throughout the process

## Files Modified
1. `backup_gui.py` - Main GUI application (3 changes)
2. `test_gui_fix.py` - Test script to verify fixes (new file)

## Backward Compatibility
- All changes are fully backward compatible
- No changes to CLI functionality
- Existing configuration files work unchanged
- No additional dependencies required

The restore button should now work correctly for all users!
